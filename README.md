# deephaven-caddy

A Deephaven reverse-proxy setup using [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com).

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

Then, connect to [https://deephaven-foo.localhost](https://deephaven-foo.localhost) or [https://deephaven-bar.localhost](https://deephaven-bar.localhost) (you'll probably need to accept the self-signed certificate).
